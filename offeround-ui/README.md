## Project Setup

(I have commited the dist folder so you can skip to step 3)

This project uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system. 

- Install gulp: `$ npm install -g gulp`

1. Install dependencies: `$ npm install`
2. Build: `$ gulp build`
3. Run: `$ open index.html`

Make sure the server is also ready
